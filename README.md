# Network Packet Capturing and Protocol Analysis

This repository documents my hands-on work exploring network protocols, traffic behavior, and simulated attack scenarios. As part of my cybersecurity training, I designed and executed packet-level experiments using tools like Scapy, Wireshark, and raw Python sockets to build a strong foundation in traffic analysis and threat detection.

## Overview

The materials in this repository reflect practical skills in:

- Crafting and sending TCP/UDP packets manually
- Capturing and inspecting network traffic
- Simulating common attacks (e.g., Smurf, Teardrop, WiFi jamming)
- Analyzing port scanning techniques and response patterns
- Understanding session persistence and HTTP behavior
- Investigating wireless authentication events (WPA2 handshake)

Each file includes a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, the approach taken, tools used, packet-level results, and final observations.

## Key Files

- `Create and Send TCP Packet using Scapy.pdf`  
- `UDP Packet Creation with socket.pdf`  
- `Simple TCP Port Scanner.pdf`  
- `Packet Capture using Scapy.pdf`  
- `Smurf Attack on UniNet Network.pdf`  
- `Teardrop Attack Prevention.pdf`  
- `WiFi Jamming Attack and Mitigation.docx`  
- `WPA2 Handshake Capture and Analysis.docx`  
- `Session Persistence with Cookies in HTTP.pdf`  
- `Wireless Network Scanning and Info Gathering.pdf`

## Skills Demonstrated

- Low-level network traffic creation and inspection
- Manual attack simulation and analysis
- Threat detection aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Strong familiarity with Scapy, Wireshark, tcpdump, and Python for networking
- Clear documentation and interpretation of results

## Purpose

This repository is intended to showcase my capability to go beyond surface-level security knowledge and work directly with packets, protocols, and simulated adversarial behavior. It’s a reflection of my commitment to understanding how attackers operate and how defenders can better detect and prevent such threats at the network layer.

## About Me

I’m a cybersecurity graduate and hands-on learner focused on DevSecOps, threat detection, and security automation. This project is part of my personal initiative to build a strong technical portfolio that reflects my readiness for real-world security roles.
